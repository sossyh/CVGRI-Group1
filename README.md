## Introduction 

Given the recent advancements in computer vision, diffusion models have garnered significant attention within the field of medicine. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of diffusion models in this domain, serving as a valuable resource for researchers navigating this rapidly evolving area.

## Background 

Diffusion models are generative models that learn to generate data(image) by simulating a process that gradually adds noise to data (forward diffusion process) and then reverses it to recover the original data (reverse diffusion process).
Forward Diffusion Process: Data is progressively corrupted by Gaussian noise over time, transforming it into pure noise.
Reverse Diffusion Process: A neural network is trained to denoise step by step, starting from noise, to recreate the data.

## Literature Review (Applications) 

### Image enhancement

* Low light image enhancement
* Imbalance and low diversity samples image augmentation
* MRI reconstruction
* Image restoration: super resolution, blurring and inpainting
* FAB Adaptive image enhancement

### Image synthesis 

* Addressing Class Imbalance: Diffusion models can generate diverse and realistic synthetic images of rare pathologies, mitigating the impact of class imbalance in medical datasets.

* Enhanced Medical Education: Diffusion models enable the creation of a limitless supply of unique synthetic medical images for educational purposes, improving training and practice.

* Mitigating Data Privacy Concerns: Synthetic medical images generated by diffusion models provide a privacy-preserving alternative to real patient data for research and development.

### Image Segmentation

* Importance of Medical Image Segmentation:
* Critical for disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring.
* Enhances precision in identifying regions of interest (e.g., tumors, lesions, organs).

* Role of Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs):
  * Emerging as powerful tools for generating accurate and diverse segmentation masks.
  * Capable of handling uncertainty and variability in medical imaging data.
* Key Advancements in DPM-based Models:
  * Improved segmentation accuracy and robustness across diverse datasets.
  * Enhanced anomaly detection using counterfactual image generation.

## Challenges and Limitations 

* Scalability: Limited generalization across diverse datasets.
* Computational Overhead: High resource requirements.
* Interpretability: Outputs lack transparency and clinical trust.
* Validation: Minimal real-world testing on clinical datasets.
* Dimensionality Reduction Challenge: Diffusion models may not be as effective as other models (like VAEs and GANs) in learning meaningful representations in their latent space.
* Slower Generation: Diffusion models generally have a slower generation process compared to some other generative models.
* Sensitive to noise scheduling

## Conclusion 

Diffusion models are transforming medical image reconstruction, enhancement, synthesis, and segmentation
Challenges persist in scalability, computational efficiency, and clinical applicability.
### Future work
* Automated Noise Schedule Optimization - Develop algorithms to automatically optimize the noise schedule during training, reducing the need for manual tuning. Since diffusion models are sensitive to noise scheduling 
* Meta learning approaches
* Combine diffusion models with other generative models such as GANs to increase interpretability 
* Exploring Diverse Modalities: Diffusion models have the potential to be applied to a wider range of medical imaging modalities beyond commonly used CT and MRI.
* Representation Learning: Diffusion models may struggle to learn semantically meaningful representations in their latent space, hindering tasks like image reconstruction and semantic interpolation.
* Transformer Architectures: While promising, the use of transformer models in diffusion models is still in its early stages, requiring further research to fully understand their capabilities.
* Privacy Concerns: The use of AI image synthesis models, including diffusion models, in medical imaging raises concerns regarding patient privacy and potential copyright violations.
* Reverse Process with Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning can be employed to optimize the inverse process of diffusion models, potentially improving their performance and efficiency.
